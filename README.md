## Overview
The password strength checker is a python-based tool that evaluates password security  based on industry best practices. It analyzes password strength in real-time and provides actionable feedback to help users create stronger, more secure passwords.

## Features
-  Checks password length and complexity based on security best practices
- Identifies weak and commonly used passwords (e.g., "123456," "password," "qwerty")
- Evaluates password entropy to assess randomness and predictability
- Provides real-time feedback and security recommendations
- Uses NIST password guidelines for evaluation criteria
- Flask-based web interface (future implementation)



## Technologies Used
- Python3
- Regular Expressions (Regex)
- NIST Password Guidlines
- Flask
